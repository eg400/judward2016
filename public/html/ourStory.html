        <h1 class="blurb-title">We met in Palo Alto....</h1>
        <p class="blurb-no-margin">Judy and Edward met under a summer’s moon in the courtyard of a downtown Palo Alto bar. Accompanied by dear friends (thank you Sally and Mani), both started chatting and found the conversation effortlessly engaging.</p>
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-leaf" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        <p class="blurb-no-margin">Judy first noticed Edward’s warm smile and kind blue eyes. Edward was very quickly charmed by Judy’s beautifully genuine manner and wonderful good humour. They were to make a very memorable first impression.</p>

        <h1 class="blurb-title">One date after another....</h1>
        <p class="blurb-no-margin">This serendipitous beginning gave way to countless dates filled with hiking, skydiving, zip lining, reading at the park, making pizzas, rolling sushi, singing karaoke, guitar lesson attempts, meditating, biking, volunteering, cooking for friends and much more.</p>

        <p class="blurb-no-margin">Even on quieter evenings, the two could be perfectly happy just "Netflix and chilling." Over the years, their shared optimism, humility, openness to learn, curiosity to explore, and love for each has only grown stronger.</p>

        <p class="blurb-no-margin">In summer 2015 Edward and Judy realized a shared desire to explore Japan. With a diamond ring in his back pocket, it was a slightly more stressful affair for Edward. After two weeks of false starts he found the right spot in the rural hills of the Kumano Kodo pilgrimage trail.</p>

        <p class="blurb-no-margin">Late evening, once again under moonlight, on a bridge over the hot springs of Yunomine Onsen, Edward proposed. Judy, though in shock and joy, said yes!</p>
